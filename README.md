# 🛡️ SENTINEL — Secure Control Plane for Tool‑Using AI Agents

![Sentinel Banner](docs/banner.png)

> **A production‑grade, agent‑safety and tool‑use control platform for autonomous AI systems — combining MCP‑based tool isolation, LangGraph and FSM orchestration, GraphRAG‑backed policy reasoning, and audit‑grade decision traces. Designed to evaluate and enforce safe agent execution at scale.**

⭐ **Star this repository** — Sentinel is built as a reference system for safe, auditable agent execution.

---

## 🔥 Why Sentinel?

**Sentinel is not a chatbot, copilot, or demo agent.**  
It is a **control plane** for **tool‑using AI agents**.

As modern LLM agents gain the ability to:
- read files
- query logs
- open tickets
- modify repositories
- interact with production systems

**prompt injection and unsafe tool execution become real security risks.**

Sentinel exists to answer a single hard question:

> *“Should this agent be allowed to do this — and can we prove why?”*

---

## 🧠 About

Sentinel is an **agent‑security research and engineering platform** built to:

- enforce **least‑privilege tool use**
- prevent **prompt‑injection‑driven actions**
- require **human approval for risky operations**
- produce **audit‑grade reasoning traces**
- compare **LangGraph vs a Custom FSM** under identical safety constraints

It is **industry‑agnostic** and applicable to:
- FAANG‑scale internal tooling
- fintech, infra, and SRE platforms
- enterprise agent frameworks
- AI governance and security research

---

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

Sentinel enforces strict separation of concerns:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Agent** | Proposes actions |
| **Gateway (Sentinel)** | Decides if actions are allowed |
| **MCP Server** | Executes tools (sandboxed) |
| **Policy Engine** | Enforces RBAC / ABAC |
| **GraphRAG** | Grounds decisions in policy and incidents |
| **Audit Store** | Persists every decision |
| **Evaluation Harness** | Compares orchestrators |

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Agent Firewall (Control Plane)
- Intercepts **all agent tool calls**
- Enforces:
  - explicit allowlists
  - role‑based and environment‑based access
  - strict input validation
- Blocks unsafe execution **before tools are reached**

---

### 🔌 MCP‑Based Tool Boundary
- All tools exposed via a **sandboxed MCP server**
- Read‑only by default
- Write actions require explicit human approval
- No direct tool access from agents

This makes tool‑use safety **concrete and enforceable**, not theoretical.

---

### 🧠 Dual Orchestration Engines
Sentinel evaluates the **same agent logic** across two orchestration strategies:

- **LangGraph**
- **Custom Finite State Machine (FSM)**

Everything else remains identical:
- LLM
- tools
- policies
- retrieval
- evaluation harness

This enables a **fair, reproducible comparison**.

---

### 📚 GraphRAG‑Backed Policy Reasoning
- Policies, incidents, and tool contracts stored in a **knowledge graph**
- Relevant subgraphs retrieved at decision time
- Decisions are grounded with:
  - policy citations
  - prior incident references
  - explicit reasoning paths

---

### 🧾 Audit‑Grade Decision Traces
Every tool proposal produces a durable record:
- decision (ALLOW / BLOCK / APPROVAL_REQUIRED)
- rationale
- policy citations
- risk score
- redacted tool arguments
- timestamps

Nothing is implicit. Nothing is hidden.

---

### 📊 Evaluation & Leaderboards
Sentinel includes a built‑in evaluation harness to measure:

- prompt‑injection block rate
- unsafe execution rate
- false‑block rate
- task success rate
- latency
- tool calls per run

Results are compared across:
- LangGraph vs FSM
- different policy strictness profiles

## 🔄 How It Works

1. A user or system submits a task  
2. The agent proposes one or more tool calls  
3. Sentinel evaluates:
   - tool permissions
   - role and environment
   - untrusted input boundaries
   - policy constraints
4. GraphRAG retrieves relevant policies and prior incidents  
5. A decision is made and persisted  
6. Approved calls are forwarded to the MCP server  
7. Tool outputs are redacted and returned

## 🤝 Why This Project Matters

Sentinel targets one of the most urgent unsolved problems in modern AI systems:

> *How do we safely allow autonomous agents to act in the real world?*

This repository answers that question with **engineering rigor, explicit safety boundaries, and measurable evaluation** — not demos.
